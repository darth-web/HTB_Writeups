# Hack The Box Lab Writeups

Starting out in Cybersecurity, HackTheBox (HTB) has been the go-to resource provided to me or anyone interested in Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking for that matter.

## Retired Machines vs Active Machines

HTB's Active Machines are free to access, upon signing up. Accessing the retired machines, which come with a HTB issued walkthrough PDF as well as an associated walkthrough from [Ippsec](https://www.youtube.com/c/ippsec) are exclusive to paid [subscribers](https://www.hackthebox.com/newsroom/vip-plus).

HackTheBox doesn't provide writeups for Active Machines and as a result, I will not be doing so either. Having said that, I *might* include some later on, albeit password-protected PDF's to maintain integrity. 

## HackTheBox in relation to OSCP Prep

Another reason for myself attempting the boxes on the HTB platform is to help me prepare for the [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/) course & exam. As a result, my writeups will have an additional vector to root machines - **manual** exploitation and privilege escalation in addition to automated exploitation with tools like Metasploit, which are not allowed in the OSCP exam. 

### Accessing the VM's 

The HTB platform uses an OpenVPN connection to access the labs and machines. Once signed up, the connection pack can be downloaded as an `.ovpn` file and imported using the OpenVPN client.

## TJnull's OSCP Prep VM's

[TJnull](https://www.netsecfocus.com/oscp/2021/05/06/The_Journey_to_Try_Harder-_TJnull-s_Preparation_Guide_for_PEN-200_PWK_OSCP_2.0.html) and the team at NetSec Focus  have compiled a list of HackTheBox VM's that are a pathway to getting started, building practical skills and preparing for the OSCP in the [HTB tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/htmlview#).

I have extracted the table and fed it into this repository and will be ticking off the columns as I move down the line.
